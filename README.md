# Austrian Web Dev Map

Searching for a job can be tiresome, this map might help a bit. Good luck!

Demo: https://austrian-web-dev-map.pages.dev/

Hobby project with Svelte v5.ðŸª„

## Why?

I like searches like https://devjobs.at/teams/search, but I think they could be improved with a more stack-focused UI.

## Data sources

I'll add new data based on latest active job offers or partner directories of CMSes / frameworks. Would be best to show companies with open job offers first, but portals like https://devjobs.at/ do a better job here (with crawlers).

## Add a company

Please just open a PR and add the data to `static/companies.json`.
