# Austrian Web Dev Companies

Looking for a job can be tiresome, this directory might help. Good luck!

Demo: https://austrian-web-dev-companies.pages.dev

Hobby project with Svelte v5. ðŸª„ Read my technical notes [here](https://dev.to/mandrasch/svelte-5-share-state-between-components-for-dummies-4gd2).

## Why?

I like sites such as https://devjobs.at/teams/search, but I think they could be improved with a more stack-focused user interface.

## Data sources

I'll add new data based on latest job offers or partner directories of CMSes / frameworks. Would be best to show companies with open job offers first, but portals like https://devjobs.at/ (with crawlers) do a better job here.

### Add (or remove) a company

Please just add the data to [`static/companies.json`](https://github.com/mandrasch/austrian-web-dev-companies/blob/main/static/companies.json) and open a PR. Or drop me a quick mail.

If you want to remove your company, please just send me a quick note: matthias-andrasch-kontakt@mailbox.org
